    $(TYPEDEF)

A high-level data structure containing necessary parameters and matrices for
constructing Wannier functions (WFs), or called, Wannierization.

In general, the problem of Wannierization is to find a set of unitary matrices
``U_{\\bm{k}}`` that gives a localized representation of the Bloch states
``\\psi_{n \\bm{k}}``. Depending on the inputs, the Wannierization problem can be
categorized into two classes:
- isolated manifold: when number of bands = number of Wannier functions
- entangled manifold: when number of bands > number of Wannier functions

# Fields
Using these accronyms,
    - `n_atoms`: number of atoms
    - `n_kpoints`: number of kpoints
    - `n_bvectors`: number of b-vectors
    - `n_bands`: number of bands
    - `n_wannier`: number of Wannier functions
the fields are defined as follows:
