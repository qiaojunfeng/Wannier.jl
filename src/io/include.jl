Note for some functions, e.g., `read_nnkp`, they are already defined in WannierIO.jl,
however, in Wannier.jl, we have some wrappers for these functions, which return a
`BVectors` instead of `NamedTuple`, so that they are better integrated with the rest of
the Wannier.jl.
Luckily, it seems if I export the new definitions, the old ones from WannierIO.jl are
hidden although I reexport them here.
