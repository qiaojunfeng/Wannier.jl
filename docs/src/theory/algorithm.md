# Algorithms

Here are some detailed explanations of the algorithms used in this package,
however, it might still be too concise, please refer to the references for full discussion.

Moreover, a good starting point for the WF theory could be[^RMP].

## Wannierization

- maximal localization for isolated bands, e.g. insulators
  - different from[^MV97], optimize on unitary matrix manifolds (adaptation of [^DLL19] to isolated bands)
- disentanglement for entangled bands, e.g. metal
  - different from[^SMV01], optimize on Stiefel manifolds[^DLL19]
- parallel transport gauge[^GLS19]
  - you can further improve the spread by optimization w.r.t. a single rotation matrix[^QMP21]
- split valence and conduction WFs from a valence + conduction calculation[^QMP21]
  - as a by-product, automated initial projection for valence or conduction WFs
  - for the initial projection of valence + conduction calculation, you can start with either
    conventional spdf projection, SCDM[^DL18], or an automated projection and disentanglement
    from pseudopotential orbitals[^QPM21]
  - different from SCDM, the valence+conduction manifold is chosen by the valence+conduction calculation,
    instead of SCDM μ and σ. Moreover, works in reciprocal space thus more memory-efficient
- constrain WF center for max localization or disentanglement[^QMP21]
  - similar to[^WLPMM14], add an Lagrange multiplier term to spread functional, but optimize
    on matrix manifolds, and applying to both max localization and disentanglement
    (whereas in [^WLPMM14] the center is constrained only during max localization)

## Interpolation

Two algorithms:

- Wigner-Seitz (WS) interpolation
- Minimal-distance replica selection (MDRS) method

for band structure along a kpath or on a grid.
